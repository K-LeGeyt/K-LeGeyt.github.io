          <h4><em>Neuroplasticity</em></h4>
          <p><strong>How does understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefit people?</strong>
            <br>
            By understanding that our abilities are not fixed and we are able to create new neural connections in our brains to learn new skills and cement that knowledge and understanding, we are able to shift our perspective on our own limitations. If we know that all we need to do is practice and put information into context that makes sense to us in order to learn, we aren't limited to what we believe our innate abilities to be. Researchers have proven that just by knowing we are able to improve we will achieve more than those who believe their own intelligence to be predetermined.
            </p> 
            <p><strong>How can I engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for my own benefit?</strong>
            <br>
            Practising what I am learning a lot will help me retain the new skills I am learning. Also that by putting something into context, simply by having to explain it to someone else, I am deepening my own understanding of what we are learning. The Slack foundations channel has been invaluable for this as if I answer someone else's query about their code I need to fully understand it and explain it without giving them the answer. Answering the course reflection & blog questions where I need to provide an analogy helps to do this as well.
            </p>
            <p><strong>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?
            </strong>
            <br>
            Both physically practising and mentally practising help to strengthen the neural networks we are creating by learning something new. Just thinking about how we do something can be almost as valuable to our retaining of the information as physically practising. Another way that helps us is to put what we are learning into the context of our own lives as when we see relationships between concepts we fire up those neurons and strengthen our neural networks by passing information along them. This helps us to be able to access information down those pathways more easily in the future. Getting a good sleep has also been linked to growth of dendrites in the brain which are at the end of neurons and help pass information from one neuron to the next. Regular exercise will benefit the brain also as it can help prevent neuron loss in the important areas of our brain associated with memory and function.

            <h4><em>Growth Mindset</em></h4>
                <p><strong>What is a growth mindset and why is it relevant?</strong>
            <br>
            The realisation that our abilities and intelligence aren't fixed and can be developed is what you would call a growth mindset. The fixed mindset sees our own intelligence as static and unable to be improved or grow. By simply changing to a growth mindset we can improve our own outcomes as we see learning as the goal rather than trying to prove our intellect. If we see failure as an opportunity to learn and not as a measurement of success we will be able to convert this into a learning experience and with effort and perseverence we can develop our talents and abilities.

            <p><strong>What surprised me when learning about growth mindset!</strong>
            <br>
            I was most surprised by the 'power of... yet' and how simply changing the terminology of not achieving something to being 'not yet' could help students to persevere and take on a growth mindset.            </p>
            <p><strong>How can I integrate growth mindset into my learning journey?</strong>
            <br>
            I did have a moment during the first week of JavaScript where I wondered if I was too old to be trying to learn so much and although I did manage to continue on I feel the growth mindset has made me realise when I tackle something and don't get it right the first time I just haven't found a solution... yet.            </p>

            <p><strong>Learning Plan - how these understandings may shape or influence my learning plan and strategy.</strong>
            <br>
            As mentioned in my learning plan I can get stuck on wanting to get something perfect or correct first time and this can limit me learning from mistakes. By switching to a growth mindset I could learn the ability to try something out that may not work first time but will possibly help me get to a solution quicker rather than being stuck in the research phase before testing.             </p>
