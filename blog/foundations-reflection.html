        <h2><em>Reflecting on my learning journey into core skills.</em></h2>
        <h5>8 December 2021</h5>
  
        <p>
            <strong>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</strong>
            <br>First was that I think I had a fixed mindset and thought I would either be able to code or wouldn't. I think that by simply learning that I can learn to do something if I just apply myself I was able to push through the tougher times when I wasn't getting the logic straight away. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Secondly, I found I have an obsessive need to get things right the first time and not try first and learn from getting it wrong. This can be quite crippling when working through a piece of code where you need to actually try something in order to figure it out. Fortunately this issue was quickly extinguished and I can now say that all I ever do is try something first to see if it works. 
        </p> 
        <p>
            The third thing I realised that I am just as shy about posting on Slack as I am in real life. I can find it difficult to start up a conversation with someone I don't know or speak to a large group and Slack feels like doing both of those things at once. I am already posting more and think this is getting better...
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>What are the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?</strong>
            <br>Understanding your values and being self aware helps you in your learning journey as you can examine why you might find something difficult or why you might react to something a certain way but if you are aware of it then you can also challenge it and move through an issue. Because programming and our learning environment are often based around teamwork you have to have good communication. Empathy is essential to this as being sensitive to other peoples feelings and their values allows for a deeper understanding of each other. This then leads to more effective communication when working together to solve problems. Self awareness lets us regulate when we are not at our best and when to step away and take a minute to assess what we can do to improve how we approach something.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</strong>
            <br>How much of an effect having a growth mindset can have on your ability to increase your skill level just by knowing you can improve it!
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</strong>
            <br>Having to put everything into a blog that other people could read! I always get nervous when other people are reading how I perceive something or my thoughts on a subject.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</strong>
            <br>Because these are the essential skills needed for working in a team of people. They also make you more appealing to employers as you will enhance their team and the working environment.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</strong>
            <br>Being older and coming back to study mid-life I have managed and worked in teams before so some of the areas covered I already have some prior knowledge. But even from that perspective I do not see it as a waste of time as I am still learning about myself and how to improve my communication with others in order to be a more effective problem solver.
