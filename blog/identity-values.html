        <h1>Identity, Values and Strengths</h1>
        <h2><em>Who am I at this point in my life?</em></h2>
        <h5>16 November 2021</h5>
  
        <p>
          <strong>Describe my core personal values.</strong>
          <br>According to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator" target="_blank">Myers-Briggs</a> type indicator personality test I took I am an <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/infj-personality" target="_blank">INFJ-T</a> which is an Advocate personality with the T standing for Turbulent. Reading through this personality type I definitely could identify with some of the core values it listed. When I self-evaluated what I think my own core values are I felt empathy, diligence and being principled were at the top.
        </p> 
        <p>
          I asked friends and family for their honest opinions and read through old work references to get a sense of how others see me. What eventuated was a bunch of warm fuzzies from people saying nice things which was rather lovely. The general consensus was that I am seen by others much as I see myself. One brave friend pointed out my tendency to be a perfectionist and how that can lead to overthinking and worry about not getting something right. I know I have this tendency and I could see it in other softer comments about "my sharp eye for detail" and being "way too hard on myself". Ultimately my core values as seen by family, friends and colleagues were that I cared about people and worked hard to help them in whatever way I can.

          <strong>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</strong>
          <br>Growing up in Aotearoa New Zealand has definitely influenced my values and identity. Kiwis are known around the world as being friendly and welcoming people and that was certainly my experience growing up here. When you are wrapped up in all that warmth it is hard not to value kindness and empathy. I do know that I was lucky and that I grew up with a good amount of privilege which means that my experience can differ greatly from other New Zealanders. I try to be cognisant of this when dealing with others and how they have been shaped by their own experiences.

          <strong>Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.</strong>
          <br>To evaluate my strengths and limitations I started with another online test called the <a href="https://high5test.com/personality-test-for-individuals/" target="_blank">High 5 test</a> which gives you your 5 highest strengths. It went into detail on what each meant but to keep it brief here they are in order of first to fifth; Empathiser, Coach, Time Keeper, Deliverer and Brainstormer. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I definitely see empathy and understanding as one of my biggest strengths and I do think I am diligent and conscientious which fits into the time keeper and deliverer listed on my results.
        </p>
        <p>
          I don't really need any kind of online test to tell my what my limitations are as I suspect most of us would be aware of our failings more than our strengths. I suffer from anxiety and that can cause me to overthink and worry. I also tend to try and get things perfect which means I can get caught up in the detail and that can be a big time waster. I can already see how this will affect my learning as there is a lot of sharing and online interaction in foundations which I find very difficult because I will be anxious about what I share and trying to get it right.
        </p>

          <strong>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension.</strong>
          <br>An example would be from in my former life as part of a front desk customer service team (my uni job that extended after I graduated due to the GFC). We had upgraded to a new CRM computer system that I had been part of both the testing and training. It was more complex but did a lot more than our very old out of date system which had major flaws. There was definite resistance to it and one memorable shift where a colleague properly freaked out in front of other staff that they weren't sure what to do. I assured them that their training would help and that I would be by their side for this shift to help them with anything they couldn't remember. They calmed down and we got through the shift with no issues but in hindsight perhaps we could have made sure the training was closer to launch date or had a quick refresher course just before a team member went on shift.
