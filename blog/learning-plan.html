          <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
          <h2><em>My learning plan for my time at EDA.</em></h2>
          <h5>16 November 2021</h5>
    
          <p><strong>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</strong>
            <br>
            Front end web development interests me the most as I feel it will best make use of my design degree and the skills of web development that I will gain from this course.
            </p> 
            <p><strong>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</strong>
            <br>
            My strengths are my strong work ethic and diligence which makes me stick to a task and complete it to the best of my ability. This leads to my limitations that stem from being a perfectionist, spending too much time on small details that aren't necessary which can slow down my progress. I can also overthink and worry about not getting something right which can limit my learning as I am more focused on correct than learning from my mistakes.
            </p>
            <p><strong>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</strong>
            <br>
            Confidence in both my ability and also presenting ideas to others.
            </p>
            <h4><em>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</em></h4>
                <p><strong>
                An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives</strong>
            <br>
            Be respectful of other people and their situations, be understanding if life gets in the way and help in any way I can. Plan a good daily routine and be available online at expected times for team meetings and lectures. To meet deadlines set by myself and others.
            </p>
            <p><strong>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</strong>
            <br>
            Take a walk, do some yoga or garden while listening to a podcast. If time is limited just getting a cup of tea and doing some mindfulness breathing for 5 minutes.
            </p>
            <p><strong>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</strong>
            <br>
            If Google/StackOverflow can't help me then the next step is my cohort channel on Slack. I will limit my time searching online for a solution so I don't spend too long on a task and miss a deadline. Next step will be the code-help-desk on Slack and finally reach out to my facilitator for help.
            </p>
            <p><strong>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</strong>
            <br>
            Feedback on how I am progressing and if I am meeting all assessment criteria is important to me. I understand that they are not necessarily there to give me the answers but help me find the solution by guiding me on the right path.
