          Emotional Intelligence is measured in how well we navigate our own emotions and those of the people around us. In the past there was a lot of focus on the Intelligence Quotient (IQ) which measures how you learn, understand and implement knowledge, logical reasoning and abstract thinking. It was believed that this was an indicator for success in life however some psychologists now suggest that success in life is no longer based on such a narrow ability but also encompasses multiple intelligences. Our Emotional Quotient (EQ) has been identified as important for indicating our ability to cope with challenges, develop and maintain relationships and communicate effectively. Think of IQ as book smarts and EQ as street smarts where your IQ will indicate how well you do at school and your EQ will indicate how well you do in life.              
        </p>

          The best part about Emotional Intelligence is that it is a skill you can learn and develop. There are four attributes that are important for Emotional Intelligence. First off you need to have good <em>self-management</em> of your emotions, impulsive feelings and behaviours and to do this in a healthy way. <em>Self-awareness</em> of your own emotions and how they affect your thoughts and behaviour as well as knowing your own strengths and weaknesses in order to have self-confidence. Empathy or <em>social awareness</em> by understanding the emotions, needs and concerns of those around you, this will also help you feel comfortable socially. Lastly, <em>relationship management</em> by knowing how to develop and maintain good relationships you will be able to communicate clearly, work well in a team and manage conflict better.

          Not only does improving emotional intelligence affect your success at work or socially but it also improves your health. It contributes to better psychological health by reducing stress and anxiety through being about to regulate our emotions better. There is also a link to physical health as it has been associated with better protection against heart disease and other chronic conditions.
        </p>

          Basically, by improving our Emotional Intelligence we can communicate more effectively, form stronger relationships and create powerful coping strategies. In the end this all leads to success in life, health and happiness.
