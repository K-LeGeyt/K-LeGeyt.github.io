        <h1>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h1>
        <h2><em>My learning plan for the EDA bootcamp.</em></h2>
        <h5>9 December 2021</h5>
        <p>
          <strong>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</strong>
          <br>My long term goal is to work in front end web development. To be able to have flexible work hours which allow me to maximise time with my child. I hope to learn skills that would help me to get small home businesses online when they may be lacking the technical skills that make it easy to do this for themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</strong>
          <br>One of my biggest strengths will be my ability to stick at a task until it is completed to the best of my ability. I hope that I will also be good at working in a team. The biggest limitation I see is that I will be afraid to look foolish if I don't understand the technical side of something straight away.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</strong>
          <br>My anxiety about speaking to people online especially if it is a group zoom call or a public message on Slack.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</strong>
          <br>Being more confident when talking about the technical side of things.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</strong>
          <br>To be guided through what we are doing and providing feedback on progress. 
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</strong>
          <br>To build on the skills I have already gained from the foundations course and develop a wider understanding of web development.

        <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
        <h2><em>My learning plan for my time at EDA.</em></h2>
        <h5>16 November 2021</h5>
  
        <p>
          <strong>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</strong>
          <br>Front end web development interests me the most as I feel it will best make use of my design degree and the skills of web development that I will gain from this course.
        </p> 
        <p>
          <strong>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</strong>
          <br>My strengths are my strong work ethic and diligence which makes me stick to a task and complete it to the best of my ability. This leads to my limitations that stem from being a perfectionist, spending too much time on small details that aren't necessary which can slow down my progress. I can also overthink and worry about not getting something right which can limit my learning as I am more focused on correct than learning from my mistakes.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</strong>
          <br>Confidence in both my ability and also presenting ideas to others.
        </p>
        <h4><em>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</em></h4>
        <p>
          <strong>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives</strong>
          <br>Be respectful of other people and their situations, be understanding if life gets in the way and help in any way I can. Plan a good daily routine and be available online at expected times for team meetings and lectures. To meet deadlines set by myself and others.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</strong>
          <br>Take a walk, do some yoga or garden while listening to a podcast. If time is limited just getting a cup of tea and doing some mindfulness breathing for 5 minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</strong>
          <br>If Google/StackOverflow can't help me then the next step is my cohort channel on Slack. I will limit my time searching online for a solution so I don't spend too long on a task and miss a deadline. Next step will be the code-help-desk on Slack and finally reach out to my facilitator for help.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</strong>
          <br>Feedback on how I am progressing and if I am meeting all assessment criteria is important to me. I understand that they are not necessarily there to give me the answers but help me find the solution by guiding me on the right path.
